Product interfaces are one of the most significant touchpoints between businesses and its customers. It's essential to handle its development and implementation with ease and discernment, before delivering it to the client. As a User Experience designer,
my work is to perform an extensive analysis to product interfaces and combine its results into seamless, visually appealing and easy to use product interfaces.

I am passionate about technology, business, and design in general. My background education is in Product Design (BA) and Technology (MA), and I have been playing with computers since the times when the internet speed was 56kb/s, images took two minutes
to load and mIRC was still a thing.

I also enjoy telling stories through documentaries, design sounds with synthesizers, and i have a small photography studio which I use as part of my work.
